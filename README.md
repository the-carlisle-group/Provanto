# Provanto
Provanto is a testing framework for Dyalog APL.

It is inlcuded with Dado, and may be run with the user command `]dada.Runtests`. Dado expects the code to be in 
`Main` and the tests to be in `Tests`, unless otherwise specified.  

Provanto is also distibuted as a single namespace script for easy copy/pasting into a project, with no need for
Dado.

And, as a Dado project itself, Provanto may be included as a dependency in the normal way.
